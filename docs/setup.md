# Setup

This repo is meant to be run inside a Dev Container.

## Quick start
1. Install Docker
2. Install VS Code + Dev Containers extension
3. Open repo → "Reopen in Container"

## Notes
This repo might become:
- a bunch of scripts
- a small web app
- a pipeline that hits an API

So keep it flexible.
